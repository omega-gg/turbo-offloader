#  placement.py -- resource-driven offloader placement, mirroring ComfyUI's MEASURED decision: it
#  measures free VRAM, subtracts reserves, and keeps a resident budget on the GPU while streaming
#  the rest (the host RAM<->disk tier self-manages via the page cache). Pure + side-effect free
#  (besides reading file sizes / CUDA mem info). Constants + upstream line references: aimdo.md.
