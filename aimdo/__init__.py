#  aimdo offload backend -- the GPL "custom block" pulled in by the (LGPL) run*.sh / server.sh
#  scripts through a generic, license-neutral seam.
#
#  The scripts never reference aimdo/comfy directly: they discover a subpackage backend/<mode>/
#  (here, backend/aimdo/ for cuda_offload="aimdo") and drive its __init__ through this interface
#  only:
#
#      pre_torch_init()                       - one-time setup that MUST run before `import torch`
#      available()                            - True once comfy-aimdo has initialised (CUDA-only)
#      supports(engine)                       - True if this backend can place `engine`
#      load_pipe(model, dtype, engine, ...)   - build a fully-placed diffusers pipeline, ready
#                                               to run
#      prepare(pipe) / reclaim(pipe) / release(pipe)
#                                             - optional per-generation / teardown lifecycle hooks.
#                                               A pipe from load_pipe is already runnable for a
#                                               single generation; these matter for a long-lived
#                                               host that caches + reuses the pipe across requests
#                                               (server.sh). No-ops for a pipe that needs none.
#
#  Everything GPL-derived lives in this backend/aimdo/ package (comfy_aimdo is the external dep;
#  the ComfyUI-style VBAR weight streaming in backend/aimdo/offload.py and the measured
#  placement in backend/aimdo/placement.py sit next to this file), so the calling shell scripts
#  stay GPL-free.
#
#  This package (__init__.py + offload.py + placement.py) is GPL; license text maintained
