#  aimdo offload backend (v2) -- the GPL "custom block" the (LGPL) runner discovers as
#  backend/<mode>/ (here backend/aimdo/ for cuda_offload="aimdo") and drives through this seam only:
#
#      pre_torch_init()                       - one-time setup; MUST run before `import torch`
#      available()                            - True once the vendored offloader imports (any device)
#      supports(engine)                       - True if this backend can place `engine`
#      load_pipe(model, dtype, engine, ...)   - build a fully-placed diffusers pipeline
#      prepare/reclaim/release(pipe)          - per-generation / teardown hooks
#
#  v2 delegates all offloading to a byte-for-byte vendored ComfyUI snapshot (aimdo/comfy/) via the
#  thin bridge in aimdo/adapter.py, so the SAME device-agnostic path serves CPU / CUDA / MPS.
#  comfy-aimdo's CUDA-only VBAR is an optional accelerator (aimdo_enabled) that streams weights
#  disk->VRAM through ComfyUI's ModelPatcherDynamic, running models larger than VRAM+RAM.
