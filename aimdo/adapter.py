#
#   The thin middleman between turboCLI's diffusers pipelines and the vendored ComfyUI offloading
#   subsystem (aimdo/comfy/). It contains the ONLY real logic in the package; everything under
#   aimdo/comfy/ is a verbatim ComfyUI snapshot. The bridge is two ideas:
#
#     1. comfy_ize(model): re-class each vanilla torch leaf module (Linear/Conv/Norm/Embedding) to
#        its ComfyUI `disable_weight_init.*` counterpart. Those classes ARE `torch.nn.X` +
#        CastWeightBiasOp, so their forward routes through ComfyUI's device-agnostic cast path
#        (forward_comfy_cast_weights -> cast_bias_weight -> cast_to) exactly when ModelPatcher flags
#        the module for offload -- and computes identically to the original op otherwise.
#
#     2. build_patcher(model): wrap the comfy-ized module in a ComfyUI ModelPatcher. From there the
#        seam drives ComfyUI's own load_models_gpu / free_memory to stream weights CPU<->device per
#        forward, the same way ComfyUI offloads a UNet -- on CPU, CUDA or MPS.
#
#   comfy_aimdo's CUDA-only VBAR path is left dormant (aimdo_enabled False) until Phase D.

    each model's own code; the diffusers analogue is that each transformer does
    `from ..embeddings import apply_rotary_emb`, binding the name BY VALUE in its own module at import.
    So we patch that name in the TRANSFORMER'S module (`type(model).__module__`) -- patching
    `embeddings` alone would not reach an already-imported binding.

    Fully model-scoped and safe:
      * Only the model's own module is touched -- other engines' modules are never affected, so a
        long-lived server that runs flux2 then z-image is fine.
      * A model whose module has no such symbol (e.g. z-image, whose rope is a complex-valued nested
        function, not a `from ..embeddings import apply_rotary_emb`) is skipped -- nothing is patched,
        numerics byte-for-byte unchanged.
      * Per call, anything outside the flux interleaved convention falls through to the original; ck
        is imported lazily only on a matching call. No device gate (ck's registry picks per device).
