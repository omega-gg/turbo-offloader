#  VBAR-residency + fast-DMA file streamer = ComfyUI's *DynamicVRAM* path, for diffusers.
#
#  Derived from ComfyUI's LOWVRAM path. Two changes turn that streamer into ComfyUI's DynamicVRAM
#  behaviour, which runs the 39 GB bf16 qwen-image transformer at ~25 s/step even when the model is
#  bigger than BOTH VRAM and RAM -- see aimdo.md, PLAN-bf16-vbar.md:
#
#    1. HOST SOURCE = fast-DMA file reader, not a staged HostBuffer. Each weight is read
#       straight from
#       its .safetensors shard into the GPU via comfy_aimdo.host_buffer.read_file_to_device -- the
#       native fast-DMA path ComfyUI uses (its read_tensor_file_slice_into
#       [CU memory_management.py L18] wraps the same primitive). The OS page cache holds the hot
#       set; the `mark_cold` flag is comfy-aimdo's RAM-pressure cache, which manages eviction (the
#       `Using RAM pressure cache` line). No 39 GB copy into RAM, and -- crucially -- NOT torch's
#       pageable `copy_` (that path measured ~128 s/step here, GPU 7 % util, transfer-starved:
#       exactly §9's "unregistered copies are synchronous and slow"). On this box cudaHostRegister
#       fails (§9), so the native reader's fast-DMA is the only way to get a fast H2D without a
#       full in-RAM HostBuffer.
#    2. GPU RESIDENCY via a VBAR. Each weight gets a VBAR slot; per forward vbar_fault() decides:
#       resident (signature unchanged) -> reuse, NO read; faulted in (VRAM free) -> read
#       file->slot; offloaded (VRAM full) -> read file->temp tensor. unpin() after lets aimdo evict
#       under pressure. This is ComfyUI's `_v` branch
#       [CU ops.py L128-L141 fault/resident, L392 unpin] -- the residency loop the plain LOWVRAM
#       streamer omits; the mechanism is the existing aimdo_flux2.py port.
#
#  Spill-safe where the LOWVRAM streamer's resident_gb wasn't (aimdo.md §9): vbar_fault() returns
#  OOM when VRAM is full -> we read into a temp tensor -> aimdo NEVER overcommits -> no WDDM
#  VRAM->RAM spill.

#
#  SCOPE (gate build): synchronous path (fault -> read -> use -> unpin) on the default stream, no
#  prefetch overlap. The double-buffer overlap is the Phase-2 add. The transformer has NO
#  checkpoint key-remap (only the Qwen2.5-VL TE does); the TE is handled by the runner, not here.

    # generation (server run_job's post-pipe finally), for any aimdo pipe. Two reclaims, in order:
    #
    # 1. Return torch's retained allocator pool to the driver == reset_cast_buffers() ->
    #    soft_empty_cache()
    #    [CU model_management.py L1383 -> L1950-1966]. The VBAR maps physical VRAM through its OWN
    #    CUDA VMM (cuMemCreate/cuMemMap per page) [AI plat.h three_stooges L182-220], SEPARATE from
    #    torch's caching / cudaMallocAsync pool, so the two compete for the same physical VRAM with
    #    nothing to arbitrate [AI README.md L54]. Between generations torch keeps the prior run's
    #    freed activation blocks cached in its pool; aimdo's alloc hook accounts that retained VRAM
    #    against the VBAR budget [AI pyt-cu-plug-alloc-async.c L166], so a persistent VBAR can't
    #    stay resident and re-streams every layer (measured: ~16 s/step vs ~2 once the pool is
    #    returned).
    # 2. Drop every VBAR's protected-resident floor (watermark_limit -> 0) ==
    #    vbars_reset_watermark_limits()
    #    [CU execution.py L549] -> [AI model_vbar.py L149, model-vbar.c L285-291]. A no-op while we
    #    never call set_watermark_limit (we juggle residency via prioritize/deprioritize +
    #    free_memory instead), ported for fidelity so a future watermark-floor use can't leak
    #    protection across generations.
    # == soft_empty_cache's CUDA path [CU model_management.py L1964-1965]: synchronize ->
