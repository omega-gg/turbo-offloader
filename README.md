# turbo-aimdo

turbo-aimdo is a [turboCLI](https://omega.gg/turboCLI) high performance offloader based on [comfy-aimdo](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-aimdo).
Paired with a compliant CUDA GPU it improves generate times substantially through optimal memory
allocations when the model does not fit into VRAM, even on a very low VRAM GPU.

## ComfyUI snapshot

turbo-aimdo's offloader is a **byte-for-byte port** of ComfyUI's memory-management / model-patcher /
ops subsystem (under `aimdo/comfy`), driven through the thin adapter in `aimdo/adapter.py`. The
port is pinned to exact upstream commits. Bump these together with the vendored files and re-apply
the short edit list in [`aimdo/comfy/resync.md`](aimdo/comfy/resync.md):

| dependency  | commit                                     | version                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| ComfyUI     | `bb131be9e83d2f773c90f1d6f1e4b248a498c8c5` | `v0.27.0`               |
| comfy-aimdo | `afa70d91ec9f6e1ab6758089d1b551f0269b6457` | `0.4.10`                |
