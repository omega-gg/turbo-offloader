#   The thin middleman between turboCLI's diffusers pipelines and the vendored ComfyUI offloading
#   subsystem (offloader/comfy/). It contains the ONLY real logic in the package; everything under
#   offloader/comfy/ is a verbatim ComfyUI snapshot. The bridge is two ideas:
#
#     1. comfy_ize(model): re-class each vanilla torch leaf module (Linear/Conv/Norm/Embedding) to
#        its ComfyUI `disable_weight_init.*` counterpart. Those classes ARE `torch.nn.X` +
#        CastWeightBiasOp, so their forward routes through ComfyUI's device-agnostic cast path
# (forward_comfy_cast_weights -> cast_bias_weight -> cast_to) exactly when ModelPatcher flags the
# module for offload -- and computes identically to the original op otherwise.
#
#     2. build_patcher(model): wrap the comfy-ized module in a ComfyUI ModelPatcher. From there the
#        seam drives ComfyUI's own load_models_gpu / free_memory to stream weights CPU<->device per
#        forward, the same way ComfyUI offloads a UNet -- on CPU, CUDA or MPS.
#
#   comfy_aimdo's CUDA-only VBAR path is left dormant (aimdo_enabled False) until Phase D.
#
#==================================================================================================

# Establishes the top-level `comfy` alias (see offloader/comfy/__init__.py).
